### Bryan Rhoton

- What went well:
    - For my part of the project what went well was the construction and testing of my system. As we tested we learned that the register address values I was using were wrong and I had to go back and fix them as best I could through trial and error. Another part of the process that went well for me was the coding of the system and being able to assist my teammates in the coding, construction and connection identification of their systems.
- What did not go well:
    - What did not go well for me was the design aspect of my system. Not only having to search the internet for what felt like days on end to find a sensor that would fit within our constraints and budget but also to find an adequate voltage regulator that would do exactly what we wanted it to.
- Problems:
    - One unanticipated problem that occured was the delay of my sensor being shipped and another was the unavailability of tbe voltage regulator that we had originally intended to use. Yet another problem was the lack of adequate documentation and datasheets for the sensor and other components of my system making it incredibly difficult to accurately code and test. One final problem that occured for my system was that the regulators we ordered, not the originals we had planned to order but a replacement, did not output voltage as they were meant to when connected to power the regultor would simply do nothing no matter how many configurations and tests we attempted the regulators simply would not output voltage.
- What would you do differently?
    - Personally what I would do differently would be to research npk sensors and voltage regulators much more in depth before I had begun to design with them. The lack of documentation and reliable sensors available make it difficult to make constraints for this kind of system let alone deliver on them so more research before hand would have been incredibly helpful.
- Best Practices:
    - Some best practices I learned were to always fully research a topic before you commit to the idea, always fully read the datasheet or documentation of products you plan to use, ensure products fit your specific needs before commiting to them and ask as many questions as needed even if you have to contact the manufactuer of the product you plan on using.
- Words of wisdom:
    - My words of wisdom would be to conduct research on your proposed problem, project or system before you commit to it. Ensure that there is adequate documentation for whatever you choose to do so you don't have to essentially make it up as you go along and research along the way.
- New knowledge or skills:
    - In capstone I increased my knowledge base of Arduino coding and libraries. I learned the very basic idea of BLE communication and functionality. I also learned very basic knowledge of how plcs and hmis work and are operated. Finally I learned an immense amount about the operation of and calculations for voltage regulators and their different functions.
