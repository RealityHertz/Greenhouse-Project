# Meeting Minutes Folder

The `Meeting Minutes` folder houses records of all team meetings conducted as part of the Autonomous Greenhouse project. Each meeting should have a corresponding Markdown file named in the format `Minutes - yyyy-mm-dd.md`.

## Requirements

- **Meeting Frequency**: Teams are required to conduct meetings at least once a week.
- **File Naming Convention**: The meeting minute files must follow the naming format: `Minutes - yyyy-mm-dd.md`.
- **Content Guidelines**:
  - Brief notes on discussions held during the meeting.
  - Document all group decisions made, regardless of their nature (e.g., yes, no, wait and see, etc.).

## Contents

The folder contains individual meeting minute files, each named according to the date of the meeting, reflecting the discussions and decisions made during that specific session.
