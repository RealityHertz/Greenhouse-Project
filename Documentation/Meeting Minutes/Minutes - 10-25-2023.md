**Agenda Items**

1\. CO2 & NO2 Design Signoff

**Action Items**

1\. Establish Better Constraints.

2\. Add labels to Buildable Schematic.

3\. Build a system based off what is needed.

4\. Use 555 to possibly tell when Arduino needs to turn on and grab/enable the sensors to receive

and send data (saves data).

5\. Nyquist rate (fastest time concentration of air can change divided by 2)

6\. Sleep Mode on Arduino?

7\. Enable/Disable on Sensors?

8\. Current Drawn On vs Off.

9\. Look at other sensors/projects and how they last for long periods of time.
