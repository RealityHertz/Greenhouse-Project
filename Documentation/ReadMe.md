# Documentation

The `Documentation` folder serves as a comprehensive repository of essential project documentation and artifacts for the Autonomous Greenhouse project. This README aims to provide guidance and an overview of the contents within this directory.

## Contents

### Signoffs

This directory contains markdown files for signoffs of subsystems. Each signoff document details the subsystem's purpose, constraints, buildable schematic, analysis, Bill of Materials (BOM), and more. Refer to the README in the "Signoffs" directory for detailed guidelines on creating and updating signoff files.

### Final Set of Prints (Final Design Artifacts)

All schematics and design artifacts, including 3D models, wiring schematics, PCB files, final BOM, datasheets, project poster, detailed project photos, and any additional relevant documents, are stored here.

#### 3D Models

Stored in `.stl` format, these models provide complete, buildable 3D representations of the various systems within the project.

#### Wiring Schematics

Electrical systems' wiring schematics, created using AutoCAD or AutoCAD Electrical, are stored here. Source files and PDF versions of the schematics must be included.

#### PCB Files

KiCad is used for all PCB design, with source files and complete gerber files included. PCB-related documents are housed within this section.

#### Final BOM

A PDF output of the Excel-based Bill of Materials (BOM) file along with the Excel file itself is included here.

#### Datasheet

This document contains vital information necessary for interfacing with the project, including power expectations, interfacing details, compliance information, experimental results, and their interpretations.

#### Project Poster

The project poster, visually representing key project details and components, is stored in this section.

#### Detailed Photos

A folder of detailed project photos provides visual documentation of the project's various aspects.

#### Additional Documents

Any other pertinent documents relevant to understanding, working on, or with the project are included in this section.
