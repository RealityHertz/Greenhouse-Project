# Images Folder

The `Images` folder contains visual assets utilized in the markdown files detailing subsystem designs and resources needed within the `Sign-offs` folder within the Autonomous Greenhouse project.

## Contents

The images are organized based on alphabetical order. They are used in various subsystem design markdown files. They aid in visually explaining and illustrating different components and concepts of the subsystems.

### Images

- **Arduino Nano 33 Schematic**
- **Lighting Control Subsystem**
- **Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Subsystem**
- **Display Chip Schematic**
- **Nutrient Subsystem**
- **PPM Graph**
- **SPI Data Out to Integer Code**
- **Temperature and Humidity Subsystem**
- **UART to Integer Code**
- **Water Level Schematic**
- **Water Level Subsystem**

## Usage

These images play a pivotal role in enhancing the understanding and visualization of the subsystem designs presented in the markdown files. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific subsystem and contains relevant images associated with that subsystem's design documentation.

## File Formats

The images are available in formats such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, or other common image formats, ensuring compatibility across various markdown rendering platforms.
