# *Detail Design: Communications Application*

## **Function of the Subsystem:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px">The Communcations Application Subsystem 
will be designed to collect, organize,
and process data that is recieved by the PLC which includes nutrient 
levels, 
humidity, temperature, CO2, and NO2 levels from sensors. All of these 
sensors
will send the data to Arduino Nano 33 BLE chips to the PLC using 
Bluetooth Low
Energy. The purpose of the Communications subsystem to the make sure 
it can 
take in the undisturbed sensor data and reorganize it into the way 
that will 
be easy for a user to read and understand. The subsystem acts as 
bridge 
between the raw data and the visualization interface. It will be used 
to see
real-time data and allow for proper decision-making.

## **Constraints:**

- **NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP**

  - The NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP needs a voltage of 3.3-5V supplied in order to 
  operate and typically uses 100mA of current.

  - Voltage supplied for LED Blacklight Driver shall be a minimum of 2.8V and a 
  maximum of 5.5V.

  - Supply Current for LED Blacklight Driver for 3.3V is typically 770mA and for 
  5V is 350mA so this system shall uphold this.

  - Blacklight PWM Frequency shall be a minimum of 800Hz and a maximum of 10,000Hz

- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**

  - The communication between the Arduino Nano 33 BLE and PLC must be wireless. This will save

    time and money on wiring, while also allowing the system to be scalable.

  - The transfer of data between the PLC and the Arduino must be nearly

    instantaneous for accurate and reliable monitoring of all sensor levels in

    the greenhouse.

  - BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is lower in cost than the classic Bluetooth as BLE is

    currently rising in use and has market competition. BLE decreases the distance a

    signal can be transmitted, but the signals transmitted through the greenhouse

    will not be far. The use of BLE allows for a cost-eï¬ƒcient alternative compared to

    classic Bluetooth.

## **Analysis:**

- **Power Supply for Arduino Nano 33 BLE**

  - The power used will need to supply 5 volts to the Pin 15 on the Nano 33 BLE.

  - The Pin 14 on the Nano 33 BLE will need to be connected to the ground from the
    power supply.

- **Communication for Arduino Nano 33 BLE**

  - The data that is needed to be able to turn this system into a useful tool 
  will be recieved via BLE from the PLC. The PLC used in this system has BLE 
  compatabilities so it will be easy to send over the required data that can 
  then be turned into readable and useful data that the greenhouse employees 
  will be able to use. The MISO pin will be the output of this data that will 
  be sent onto the display.

- **Power Supply for NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP**

  - The NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP has a supply voltage of 3.0-3.6V and
  will have power supplied through a wall outlet with a USB 2.0 cord 
  powering the voltage in and ground
  - The NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP will also be supplied the proper Idd 
  from a Vdd of 3.3V or within the previous voltage parameters. The 
  current should fall around 100mA. [1]

- **Communication for NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP**

  - The primary communication will come from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE 
  MISO pin connected the the MOSI pin on the NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP.
  - The communnication will be controlled by using the SCK digital pin 
  on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE which can be set up by putting code to 
  mimic a desired clock cycle. We will then take this digital signal 
  and send it through the SCK pin on the Arduino to the SCK recieving 
  pin on the NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP.
  - The Chip Select on the NHD-5.0-800480FT-CSXP-CTP will also be set 
  up to a digital pin on the Arduino so that can be configured as 
  desired.
  - Most of the communcation will be written as code on the Arduino which will recieve data from the PLC controller. It can then be reorganized into graphs and readable data on the display to make for ease of understanding for the greenhouse employees. [2]
