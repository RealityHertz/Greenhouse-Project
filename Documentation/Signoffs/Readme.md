# Signoffs Folder

The `Signoffs` folder holds signoff markdown files for each subsystem within the Autonomous Greenhouse project. These files adhere to specific guidelines for submitting and updating signoffs as outlined below.

## Content

  - **CO2 & NO2 Monitoring Subsystem Signoff**
  - **Lighting Control Subsystem Signoff**
  - **Display Subsystem Signoff**
  - **Water Level Subsystem Signoff**
  - **PLC Subsystem Signoff**
  - **Nutrient Monitoring Subsystem Signoff**
  - **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring Subsystem Signoff**

## Sections in Signoff Markdown File

Each signoff markdown file must include the following sections:

### Function of the Subsystem

Explain the primary function and role of the subsystem. Clarify its atomic purpose as outlined in the conceptual design.

### Constraints

Detail the constraints for the subsystem, explaining the rationale behind each constraint. Constraints may arise from physics, other subsystem requirements, standards, ethics, or socioeconomic considerations.

### Buildable Schematic

Embed a clear and appropriately sized schematic directly into the markdown file as a JPEG image. Ensure the schematic contains all necessary details for someone unfamiliar with the design to build it. Upload the actual design artifacts (e.g., 3D models, CAD files, gerber files) to the documentation folder in the appropriate location.

### Analysis

Provide a comprehensive analysis of the design, demonstrating how it meets the constraints and functions as intended. Ensure the analysis is well-explained and convincing to the faculty supervisor.

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

Include a markdown table listing all components required for the design, along with the cost of each component and the total cost of the subsystem.
