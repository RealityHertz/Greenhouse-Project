# Autonomous Greenhouse Project

## Executive Summary

With this project Team 2 proposes to create a greenhouse that can wirelessly and autonomously detect soil moisture, pH level, and nutrient level as well as carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide in the greenhouse's atmosphere along with the greenhoue's temperature and humidity. The greenhouse will also be able to autonomously detect the water level of an exterior water source and fill said resevoir when the level is too low as well as running a timed watering cycle for the plants. 


## Capabilities

This version of the project will be able to accurately measure the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the greenhouse soil as well as the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide levels in the atmosphere. The project will also be able to detect the water level of an external resevoir that will alert when low and be able to refill when the alert is sent.


## Salient Outcomes

Currently there are no outcomes for the Autonomous Greenhouse project.

## Project Demonstration & Images

There is no demonstrations currently available.

### Faculty Supervisor

The faculty advisor for the project is Jesse Roberts.

### Stakeholders

The customer for this project is the Agricultural Department at Tennessee Technological University. A scalable version of this design would be useful for agricultural researchers, farmers, and/or urban growers.

### Recognitions

Team 2 would like to recognize the sponsor for this project, EOSYS. They have worked closely with the group to help provide feedback, troubleshoot, and brainstorm ideas for the project. 

## Repo Organization

Give the layout of the repo and what can be found where. Make it easy on those who are interested by making the headings of the various things in this section clickable links to the relevant folder or file in the repo.


### Reports

In the reports section of this repository information about the individual expectations for the reports and how they should be housed is provided.

### Documentation

In the documentaion section information regarding the documentation that is required and how it should be organized is given.

### Software

In the software directory of the repo information regarding how each team is expected to document software can be found.
