# Autonomous Greenhouse Project

## Executive Summary

With this project Team 2 proposes to create a greenhouse that can wirelessly and autonomously detect soil moisture, pH level, and nutrient level as well as carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide in the greenhouse's atmosphere along with the greenhouse's temperature and humidity. The greenhouse will also be able to autonomously detect the water level of an exterior water source and fill said reservoir when the level is too low as well as running a timed watering cycle for the plants. 


## Capabilities

This version of the project will be able to accurately measure the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the greenhouse soil as well as the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen monoxide levels in the atmosphere. The project will also be able to detect the water level of an external reservoir that will alert when low and be able to refill when the alert is sent.


## Salient Outcomes

Currently, there are no outcomes for the Autonomous Greenhouse project.

## Project Demonstration & Images

There are no demonstrations currently available.
