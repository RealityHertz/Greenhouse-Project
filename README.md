# Autonomous Greenhouse Project

## Executive Summary

With this project Team 2 proposes to create a greenhouse that can wirelessly and autonomously detect soil moisture, pH level, and nutrient level as well as carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide in the greenhouse's atmosphere along with the greenhouse's temperature and humidity. The greenhouse will also be able to autonomously detect the water level of an exterior water source and fill said reservoir when the level is too low as well as running a timed watering cycle for the plants. 


## Capabilities

This version of the project will be able to accurately measure the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the greenhouse soil as well as the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen monoxide levels in the atmosphere. The project will also be able to detect the water level of an external reservoir that will alert when low and be able to refill when the alert is sent.


## Salient Outcomes

### 1. Soil Moisture, pH, and Nutrient Level Detection
- **Outcome:** Develop a system that provides real-time data on soil conditions, allowing for precise adjustments to watering schedules and nutrient applications. This could lead to optimized plant growth and reduced resource waste.

### 2. Atmospheric Monitoring (CO2 and NO2 Levels)
- **Outcome:** Implement sensors that continuously monitor and log the levels of CO2 and NO2. This data could be used to adjust ventilation, maintaining optimal air quality for plant health.

### 3. Temperature and Humidity Control
- **Outcome:** Create a responsive system that adjusts internal temperature and humidity based on preset thresholds. This could help in maintaining a stable environment that promotes plant health and productivity.

### 4. Water Level Monitoring and Reservoir Refilling
- **Outcome:** Design an automated system that detects low water levels in an external reservoir and alerts for manual intervention. This ensures a consistent water supply for the greenhouse, crucial for plant survival and growth.

### 5. Adjustable Lighting System
- **Outcome:** Implement a lighting system that can adjust the duration of grow light exposure based on Human-Machine Interface (HMI) inputs. This allows for flexible light management tailored to the growth stages and needs of different plant
